# Filming

* You should always have a minimum of two people taking part in the shoot. You will need to adopt separate roles – one person filming, one directing and ideally one for continuity/overview.
* It is good to have a variety of shots from different angles to splice together - this looks better than shots from a moving camera. Once in position keep the camera still.
* Always use a tripod or equivalent, regardless of the equipment you are shooting with, to ensure your footage remains steady. Handheld footage is not acceptable.
* Avoid zooming in and out – this can distracting/disorientating, and looks unprofessional.
* Do not use special effects. For transitions, we recommend only using dip to black, dip to white, and crossfade.
* We would recommend using a dedicated video camera rather than a smartphone or similar. The web team have a camera which you can use.
