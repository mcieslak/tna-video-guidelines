# Filming

## Quick overview

* You should always have a minimum of two people taking part in the shoot. You will need to adopt separate roles – one person filming, one directing and ideally one for continuity/overview.
* It is good to have a variety of shots from different angles to splice together - this looks better than shots from a moving camera. Once in position keep the camera still.
* Always use a tripod or equivalent, regardless of the equipment you are shooting with, to ensure your footage remains steady. Handheld footage is not acceptable.
* Always use an external microphone to ensure good quality sound, not the one built into the camera.
* Avoid zooming in and out – this can distracting/disorientating, and looks unprofessional.
* Do not use special effects. For transitions, we recommend only using dip to black, dip to white, and crossfade.
* We would recommend using a dedicated video camera rather than a smartphone or similar. The web team have a camera which you can use.
* Over-shoot – lots of footage will give you room to edit.
* We are aiming for competence, not art. 

## Preparing a shoot

Extensive preparation is crucial before you pick up the camera. Know what you want to achieve and an idea of how you want to achieve it. A storyboard – a step-by-step visual respresentaion of your video - is a good start.
