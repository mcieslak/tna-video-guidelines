# Video standards and guidelines for web

## Before you start

**Consult the Web Team!** We have expertise and standards which all our videos need to meet. We must be involved in any videos you are intending to include on our website, whether hosted on our Archives Media Player or our YouTube channel.

The first step is always to ask the question: Do we need a video? The answer is "No" more often than it's "Yes". Videos are not good for delivering lots of information and detail (that's done better with words and graphics). Videos are good for explaining ideas.

Before picking up a camera, make sure we know:

* exactly what the video needs to say
* who is the audience
* what is the user need
* how will it be delivered (on YouTube? Media player? Something else?)

The video must have:

* a direct link to our records (preferably with catalogue references) and/or our purpose as an organisation
* value – eg help users with research, educational value
* appropriate credits if funded by/created by us, and copyright statement if it is ours
* integrity – be of a high standard that we are proud to promote on our site
