# Music

Ensure we have copyright/copyright clearance for any music used, or licence for use.

There are separate copyrights for dubbing music so if in doubt about the copyright status of either the piece of music or the specific recording/version, contact PRS before you edit in the track. There may be fees.

It can be distracting having music playing in the background throughout a video, particularly in addition to a voiceover â€“ use sparingly, ideally only if it is relevant to the content of the video.
