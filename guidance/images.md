# Images

Ensure that we have copyright or appropriate permissions for use. Ideally they should be our own images - from our collections (see the Image library) or that we have taken ourselves. Never use images simply taken from a Google image search.

If you take a photo to use in the video it will be covered by Crown copyright.

If you use a document from The National Archives, include the catalogue reference (and source) in a caption. Check our guidance on how to cite our records.

### Handling of original documents

Contact Collection Care as they may want to advise or even supervise filming. Do not include pencils in shot with document, or people using gloves!

### Screenshots of our website, including Discovery

Please be aware this may date quickly - keep an eye on any changes coming up for new releases, that is, doesnâ€™t look or function too differently.

You should be able to slot in new images easily if they are screenshots.
