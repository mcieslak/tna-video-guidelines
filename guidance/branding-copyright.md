# Branding and copyright

The video should include our branding if it’s created by us. Ensure that you use the most up to date version of the logo (A to the left, not above The National Archives - contact the Marketing and Communications team if in doubt). Use a cover sheet such as in our document handling video (Web Team can provide this). If the video is ours, it must have our copyright notice at the end.

As a credit sheet at the end of videos:
